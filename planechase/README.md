# About
Planechase is a multiplayer variant of Magic: the Gathering. Here are the [rules of the format](https://magic.wizards.com/en/formats/planechase) and here is the app [URL](https://planechase-2024.vercel.app/).

## How to Use
### Home Screen

When you open up the app, you will see the home screen with the prompt to enter a list of cards (Planes and Phenomena). When you click Search, it will make a [Scryfall](https://scryfall.com) query to collect the list of the planes and phenomena entered. This query will only find planes and phenomena, and if you put in a name that is not recognized as one of those it will be ignored.

If you want to just play with all of the planes, click "Give me all the planes!"

### Game Screen

After pulling the list of planes, a session code will be appended onto the end of the URL. Sharing the URL with other people will allow you all to have a synchronized game. Changing the plane and rolling the die will be reflected on other players' sessions. The sync happens on an interval of 2 seconds (A future update will have an update to have this happen in real-time).

# Running the project locally
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
